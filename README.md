"Lab 2 Project" 

This is for project 2 for the lab assignments. It is to get a better understanding of Git, Maven, and all the other processes we might use!

Within the .gitignore it is important to have these patterns / commands to properly build and execute our code. It helps with organization and running the overall project with settings/software.
