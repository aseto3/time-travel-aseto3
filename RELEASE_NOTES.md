#v1.0 - Release notes on all updates/changes 

Features:
Features and fixes that happened within this project were all git focused so far. I needed to create a local repo then push the commits and branches to the remote repo on github. I also created branches, commits, changes, and conflicts. There was also practice within PR and when they have conflicts and how to resolve them properly.

Commits:
All the commits are generally though the process 1-1.14. They are all relevant and are a proof of history as I was working through the project. PR were intresting as I never have seen them like that before. I don't fully undertsand but definitly have a better understanding now.
